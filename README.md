# vulnarable_python_application

Hello! This is my vulnerable Flask web application, there are few vulnerabilities yet, but donâ€™t worry, the project will be further developed and updated as soon as possible, and the code will also be rewritten in node.js

Before running the application, you need to install the libraries
```pip install requirements.txt```

And then run main.py

```python3 main.py```

That's all for now, good luck in the pentest!
